# Kryva

**A Consequence-Aware Skill Gap Self-Diagnosis System**

---

## Overview

Kryva is an innovative educational application designed to revolutionize how students approach academic challenges. Unlike traditional learning platforms, Kryva focuses on identifying and prioritizing skill gaps based on their potential academic consequences, helping students make informed decisions about their learning priorities.

### The Problem

Many first-semester students face significant academic hurdles not due to lack of motivation, but because of **misprioritization of learning**. Traditional educational tools overlook critical elements of timing and consequence, forcing students to make crucial academic decisions under immense pressure, often leading to:

- Undue stress and anxiety
- Poor grades
- Higher risk of early academic attrition
- Irreversible skill gaps that compound over time

### Our Solution

Kryva addresses this by treating academic success as a **decision-making problem** rather than a motivation issue. The system:

- Diagnoses critical skill gaps
- Evaluates their potential for serious academic damage
- Focuses exclusively on time-critical skill deficiencies
- Provides clear, self-guided, actionable steps to mitigate risks

## Key Features

### 1. **Consequence-Aware Prioritization**
Unlike traditional skill assessment tools, Kryva uniquely prioritizes skill gaps by their academic consequence, identifying which deficiencies could become irreversible if not addressed promptly.

### 2. **Adaptive Skill Assessment**
Intelligent, adaptive testing that pinpoints specific areas needing improvement without overwhelming students.

### 3. **Personalized Action Plans**
Time-sensitive, tailored learning paths with step-by-step guidance designed around each student's unique needs and course structure.

### 4. **Early Intervention System**
Proactive identification of irreversible failure risks before they become critical problems.

### 5. **First-Semester Focus**
Specifically designed to address the unique challenges faced by first-semester students navigating new academic environments.
